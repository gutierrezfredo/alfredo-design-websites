<h1> Alfredo Gutierrez </h1>

I design digital products that solve real business problems. As a UX designer at Orchid Software Solutions, I create operational software for the surrogacy industry. Over 7 years, I've helped companies scale by building reliable, custom solutions—like [OMP Racing](https://ompracing.com) and [Bell Racing](https://bellracing.com) for Racing Force Group—across healthcare, government contracting, and legal services.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about [poetry](https://alfredo.blog/), surfing, music, learning languages, photography, and traveling.

I share my thoughts and tutorials on design, projects, and personal life on my [blog](https://alfredo.design/blog/). You can also see what I'm currently working on in my [professional changelog](https://alfredo.design/logs/).

<h1> Alfredo Gutierrez </h1>
Over the past 10 years, I’ve helped scale startups and companies by developing custom, reliable software that streamlines business processes across the racing, healthcare, surrogacy, legal services, and government contracting industries.

These are some of the recent projects I have designed and developed:
- [OMP Racing](https://ompracing.com/)
- [BELL Helmets](https://www.us.bellracing.com/)
- [Thomas & Thomas](https://thomasandthomas.flywheelsites.com/)
- [Nnaico - AI Consulting Agency](https://www.nnaico.com/)

Outside of work, I'm passionate about [poetry](https://alfredo.blog/), surfing, music, learning languages, photography, and traveling.

## I’m always a big YES to new opportunities

If you would like us to work together, just get in touch through the contact form or feel free to send me an email.
